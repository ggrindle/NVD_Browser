# NVD_Browser
The challenge is to create a Python3 based application that interacts with the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) API to fetch, display, and manage CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data.

Details about this API can be found here: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/start-here.

Requirements include:
<ul>
<li>An API key that can be generated from https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key</li>
<li>Python v.3.12 or greater</li>
<li>Outbound connectivity to https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0</li>
</ul>
